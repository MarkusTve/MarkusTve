3D VR Experience made with Unity. Five weeks of development time together with five other students. This was my first project working with VR, it came with a lot of new challenges such as completely new input and camera interactions. Therefore our focus was directed towards something creative that utilizes it's features and pushing it's limits. I worked mostly on the input and flying part. My goal was to simulate how a bee would fly, the challenge became figuring out how a bee's movement can translate over to VR input.
