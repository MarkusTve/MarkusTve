###  [To Be A Bee](https://yrgo-game-creator.itch.io/to-be-a-bee) | Oculus Quest 2


3D VR Experience made with Unity. Five weeks of development time together with five other students. This was my first project working with VR, it came with a lot of new challenges such as completely new input and camera interactions. Therefore our focus was directed towards something creative that utilizes it's features and pushing it's limits. I worked mostly with input and figuring out how flying should work. At first I thought to imitate the bee's movement directly but i quickly realised that flapping the controllers up and down in order to move was going to be greatly cumbersome. The next idea was more focussed around how the player would experience fligth in VR rather than how a bee would actually move. The idea was to give the player a Superman-like flight whereas the player would move as soon as the player moved their arms forward. The implementation was quite crude at first but the flight felt way better. The next challenge was to dial the sensitivity up and down in order to find the optimal flight experience. After a hefty amount of testing something still did'nt feel right. The flight felt overly responsive, and it was impossible to hover. Next I implemented a deadzone so that hovering was possible. I also changed so that the direction your hands where pointing was relative to a point in space slightly below the HMD but still attached to it. This made flying more managable and felt more natural. One issue that was prominant throughout development was the takeoff whilst grounded made it feel like you where'nt ever on solid ground. To solve this I thought of a way for the player to push itself off the ground before resuming flight. As long as the player was on the ground and quickly moved both controllers towards the floor the player would be propelled upwards and flight could be amensed. This change made landing and going to the next place a lot more rewarding and fun.
